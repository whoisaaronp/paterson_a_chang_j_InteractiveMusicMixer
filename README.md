## How does it work:

1. User chooses from a set of ambient sounds and melodies.
2. Drag the icons to the top center console that reads 'Drag Here'.
3. Melody/Ambient start playing.
4. Drag from any amount of the 8 different ambient sounds. [birds, waterfall, wind{thorugh forest}, 
	ocean{water hitting the shores}, fire wood, raindrop, people talking{background noise}, & crickets.
5. The melody and ambient music play together.
6. The Reset[R] Button works are a pause/reset function that holds the same track called after the reset is pressed again.

## Getting Started
Have a series of meetings regards who's going to design and develop. 
What need interactions would we like to see on the interface?
